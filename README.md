# File Upload Web Component

This repository is a fork from  https://winhowes.github.io/file-upload/components/file-upload/ and contains an element for file uploads using ajax. It supports multi-file selection, image upload preview as well as optional drop zones for drag-and-drop. The element is designed for use in Polymer 1.0.

Thumbnails are created inside an HTML5 Canvas.  These appear in grayscale and once upload has completed will fade to colour. To modify thumbnails sizes see canvas-render element. 

For usage see original documents here: https://winhowes.github.io/file-upload/components/file-upload/.

# Installation

```
bower install --save file-upload
